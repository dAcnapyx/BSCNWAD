Limitations : 

- Can't use space when naming project, route or template

- Can't add tables or make them dinamicly rendered ( with smarty foreach ) because of the way the browser renders tables and the wa—É that is used to make the html and smarty tags editable

- Can't use custom attributes ( like data-something ) in html tags because of the html parsing problems
